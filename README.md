A window should open on your computer, accessing this harm reduction gameâ€™s start screen. 
On Github, our repository is: https://github.com/19662005/CSProject2.git
Our final code, which runs the game, is titled pygameinstall.py. All other scripts are evidence of our work, testing and trying different ideas, trying to improve our game, even though we might not have used them in the end.
